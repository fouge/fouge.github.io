## The Blue Ocean strategy

It's been one month. One month of containment due to the spreading virus, but also for me, one month in the full-time adventure of freelancing. It's only starting and I am grateful to have plenty of things to do during those special times. I came back from 11 months of travel 2 weeks ago and my girlfriend and I are now at my parents' house in the countryside, enjoying the space we have üêÆü§†.

Working from home was initially the plan for me anyway. Containment gives even more time to setup everything and I take advantage of it as much as I can. Beeing a freelancer is my first step into entrepreuneurship. I am asking myself many questions about how to communicate and how to sell my skills to convince my ideal customers to contact me (and because I actually like the science of marketing üìà). I read many articles and listen to many podcasts to discover methods like content strategy or presence on social networks. My first steps were to create that website and I am willing to post articles regularly in the blog.

Yesterday, I listened to [an episode of Young Wild and Freelance](https://thomasburbidge.com/creer-metier-toute-piece/) (üá´üá∑), where Thomas and Romain are talking about finding - or even creating - the market area where you want to be top of mind ([TOMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-of-mind_awareness)); meaning that if anyone is looking for someone like you, you will be known to fulfill that need from enough people to be contacted. To do so, Thomas talks about [the Blue Ocean strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy) which aims to create and capture "blue oceans": unexplored new market areas. With this technique in mind, they advise to list 10 domains you would use to describe what you do. From that list, choose one and do the same exercise again and again to finally define a specific area which could define you as _a unique person_. 

So, I took a pen and paper and tried to list sub-domains defining my value proposition: building connected devices, _ie_ the Internet of Things (IoT). Around that domain I found many skills I developed along the years working on devices and many others that I want to learn and practice. I plotted that graph and I wanted to share it here, because graphs are beautiful üòç.

## The Internet of Things and I

After more than 5 years building connected devices, I learned a lot. Freelancing is now giving me the opportunity to learn even more, in areas I didn't get the chance to work on.

On that graph, I listed a set of domains and sub-domains I think are together making the Internet of Things. They are probably others or maybe you wouldn't have classified the Internet of Things like this: please let me know your thoughts.

I colored the sub-domains differently based on what they are to me:

- üíö Ask me anything about it, I can respond to you. 
- üíô I have experiences without being a complete expert. Ask me if you have projects involving those, I would be pleased to help! ü§ì
- üíõ I want to know more! I dedicate one day a week at making those yellow circles green. Please tell me you have a project for me!
- ‚òëÔ∏è I won't dive into those in the near future. There are many others that I didn't write here. Internet of Things can be a huge playground to play into...

Even if it may seem like this graph gives the whole picture of my work, it's not that close. My main tool being a computer, I don't specify here that I work on a Linux-based OS, that I use Git for versioning or that I prefer this IDE over that one. 

## Uniqueness

In my quest to define me as a unique person, making that graph gave me a better understanding of what I am capable of, and where I am willing to make progress. But that's not it.

I am convinced that Distributed Technologies will soon automate transactions: being monney or data exchanges. I read a lot about what's going on in that space regarding finance (like DeFi applications) and I am passionate about it. I would love to be part of that evolution and based on my knowledge around IoT, I am willing to work on demos involving both connected devices and blockchain.

I have a lot to learn, and I am excited about it.

## What about you?

If you are reading those lines, it means you are probably familiar with the IoT. I would love to build a better graph thanks to you. Please add sub-domains that are missing or re-organize the nodes so that I can grasp your understanding of the IoT. Then, download the graph (JSON file) and send it to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyrilfougeray/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyrilfougeray). I will post your contributions on the article directly.
