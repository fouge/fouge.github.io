Following [my last post](https://www.cyrilfougeray.com/2020/04/20/IoT-knowledge-graph.html) regarding where I am heading in my professional career, I said I wanted to learn more about blockchains, and now I am telling you I am building a blockchain. 

What? ü§Ø

In fact, I already made some progress by looking at the current state of the art in blockchain technologies.

As you know, it all started with Bitcoin back in 2009. I already know a lot about Bitcoin but I never read the white paper. As for many other thing, I think it's important to start with the beginning so I am going to read that important paper first. Learning the theory is great to start but I feel that I cannot fully understand if I don't put my hands in it.

## Learning by doing

Nowadays, distributed applications are mainly based on Ethereum because it offers the possibility to issue new tokens based on the Ethereum standards (ERC-20 for example) using Ethereum programs called _Smart Contracts_. The more applications built on this blockchain, the more will be built on it: [Ethereum is an emergent structure](https://bankless.substack.com/p/ethereum-is-an-emergent-structure?r=1ua7a&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy) (Bankless newsletter is very interesting ü§ì).

Ethereum is here to stay but while I was learning about the basics of how data is being transacted on the Ethereum blockchain, I stumbled upon [Parity](https://www.parity.io/), cofounded by Gavin Wood who is also a cofounder of Ethereum with Vitalik Buterin. Parity has been developing the source code behind one [Ethereum node](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum) until recently and is now focusing on two products: Substrate and Polkadot.

You never heard about those, so you might be wondering why are they so important?

Fortunately, I already heard about Polkadot by Eric Larchev√™que from Ledger in a podcast I listened. At that time, I didn't know anything about Polkadot but only took note of it without going much further. Now that I took a closer look, I can say that those are very interesting for me who wants to learn more about blockchain technologies.

The goal of Polkadot is to make blockchains interoperable so that any type of data or asset can be transferred among the various blockchains. While building Polkadot, the experienced team at Parity thought that all those software bricks could be made available to anyone as generic libraries for them to build other blockchains, so they built Substrate.

A quote directly taken from the [website](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/):

> "Substrate is a framework for creating cryptocurrencies and other decentralised systems **using the latest research in blockchain technology**". 

*ie* Substrate builds blockchains, like Polkadot which is now fully based on Substrate. Who was born first? üê£üôÇ

Polkadot is very interesting because it is using the best of blockchain technologies. For example, it is governed by its users which ensure that evolutions will come smoothly and that it won't be forked which is one of the main argument for another very interesting project I am following closely: [Tezos](https://tezos.com/). It will be interesting to see how they compare.

Substrate is now providing developers the tools to create blockchains compatible with others based on the framework. They can all run on Polkadot.

In a technological standpoint, the framework is written in Rust and I want to improve in that language. Plus, runtimes (*ie* Smart Contracts) can be written using WebAssembly which is a bet from Parity as WA is really young but as [Fredrik (Parity's CTO) puts it](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/sub0-online/2), WA is future-proof.

Frameworks are great when they are being used by developers so the documentation available is extensive and neat, which is a really good point for me. Many videos are available and they just broadcasted the Sub0 conference last week, [available online](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/sub0-online), while I can also watch the one from last year.

So, this is all looking good and I already have several questions I want to answer:

> What are the actual benefits of making interoperable blockchains against an ERC-20 token?

My guess is that building on Ethereum can be constraining as the token is dependent on the Ethereum platform, nodes, congestion, etc. But then arises that new question:

> How much can we configure the new blockchains created with Substrate?

I guess a lot. If those are totally configurable, it means I will have to learn a lot from all the different configurations and features a blockchain can use. From what I have seen, Parity made choices which implies ousting configuration options, but since I am not an expert, I am not able to complain and the team behind the project seems to take thoughtful decisions.

## Conclusion 

Substrate is making the task of getting the hands dirty way easier than a few years back, while still being challenging, becoming the best choice for me to dive into the blockchain technologies. I used to read articles treating blockchain randomly but by leveraging Substrate, I can improve my learning curve: I only have to follow the beaten track.  

Make sure to follow along if you are interested in learning more about blockchains as well.
